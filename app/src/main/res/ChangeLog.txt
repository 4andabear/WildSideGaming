v.0.0.1 - 5/5/17

Changed text that was a string to a reference link, so customer can easily chnage text in app
Also, found where the color references are and what parts they change


v.0.0.2 - 5/10/17

I have implemented a webview for a live stream, and will not be using the embeded live stream that java can do.

v.0.0.3 - 5/12/17

During the previous week, I continued to adjust string reasources, and I was making new XML files, and I got the Live Feed file working, but not intergrated into the app.


v.0.0.3 - 5/17/17

During this week I moved onto just working on new XML files for future clas that will be made.  I added in a horizantal scrollview into the app which will display the 5 most recent videos posted by wildsidegaming.  This will allow for the user to see the recent videos, or clips, posted by wildsidegaming.  At this time, I am taking a break as there is a mojor bug with in the code.  I will hopefully continue to edit the code and publish this app with in the next six to nine months.
